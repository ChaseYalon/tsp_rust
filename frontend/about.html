                Hi, my name is Chase Yalon. I am 15 years old and from Moorestown, New Jersey. I am currently
                a freshman at Moorestown High School. This is my third year in the Coriell Science Fair, and I look
                forward to presenting my project. Some things I enjoy are running, biking, camping, programming,
                and debate. I also enjoy spending time with friends and eating (an unhealthy amount).

            The Traveling salsmen problem was first proposed by Merrill M. Flood (1) in 1930. The basic idea of
            the problem is as follows. Imagine you are a bus driver with 20 stuents to drop off. For the sake of example
            each student
            has their own stop. Now find the shortest route starting and ending at the school that hits each stop
            exactly
            once. This is the traveling salsmen problem. Now taking that example from earlier, the most ovbious idea is
            to
            simply try every option and find the shortest one. Now this will work by here is the problem. The number of
            possible routes is <sup>(n-1)!</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> or 608225500000000000 possible routes. That is
            608,000 TRILLION routes.An average compuer
            brute forcing or trying every permutation would take longer then the age of the universe. So that is where
            my algoirthm comes in.

            The traveling salsmen problem has many practical applactions. Half are direct, meaning a solution or even
            a signifagant improvemnt to the traveling salsmen probelm would bring about great change. Some example are
            package routing, Protien Folding and many more. There are also numerous indirect applications due to a
            propertey
            called NP-Completeness. The basics being that if you can prove you have solved the traveling salsmen problem
            that
            proof can be used to solve a whole range of problems. This is perhaps the most important application of the
            travling salsmen probelm.
